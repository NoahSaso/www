        <p>
            I'm a builder, psychedelic advocate, and human recently graduated
            from UC Berkeley with a degree in
            Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. At the moment, DAOs and
            psychedelic medicine pay the
            most rent in my mind. I enjoy music, nature, spending time with
            others (and myself!), and building things
            that deepen people's connections with themselves, loved ones, and
            the surrounding life.

                a DAO that builds tools for creating your own DAOs
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                A DAO is an organization democratically controlled by its
                members. Think worker-owned cooperative
                business structure, with communally-chosen rules &amp;
                procedures enforced through software instead of
                the overly bureaucratic and expensive legal system. Essentially,
                a DAO is a cross between
                a transparent, secure voting system and a bank account that
                doesn't rely on a corruptable
                centralized authority. Optimistically, DAOs lower the financial,
                technical, and geographical barriers to
                organizing a collective around a mission.

                effort

                easy as
                possible. It aggregates substance and interaction information

                Steganography tool able to encode/decode images with encrypted
                text
                (currently using PGP) in an undetectable way that survives
                industry-standard image compression, making it easy to send
                encrypted
                messages through insecure channels without alerting anyone to
                the
                presence of encrypted communications.
